TCZ Package Repository / Scripts for TinyCoreLinux

Not ready for use yet.
works well for persistant environments that need changes to files in /etc/ to stay

run install.sh on fresh harddrive to setup a persistant home directory / encryption options soon hopefully with swap
	
thenuse factor5 to build packages it can also install itself without using install.sh
