TCZ Package Repository / Scripts for TinyCoreLinux

run install.sh on fresh harddrive to setup a persistant home directory / encryption options soon hopefully with swap
	
thenuse factor5 to build packages it can also install itself without using install.sh


if you are using x11vnc server sometimes it freezes while click dragging windows so plug in a mouse and click with that to unfreeze it.


> it would be nice to get a build script and a torrent for a complete working version compiled from source. somethings are out of date but still do the job, if your looking for speed enhancements try updating some of the packages. a git repository with all the build scripts needed would work too could even retrieve everything from github.


wget -r --no-parent --reject "index.html*,tar,zip,bz,xz,7z,gz,gz2,bz2" tinycorelinux.net/13.x/arch/tcz/src/ -k
